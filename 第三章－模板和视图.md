# Chapter 3. Templates and Views 第三章 模板和视图

This chapter could alternatively be titled The Flask Chapter, because we will cover two of the most recognizable components of the framework: the Jinja2 template language, and the URL routing framework. Up to this point, we have been laying the foundation for the blog app, but we have barely scratched the surface of actual Flask development. In this chapter, we will dive into Flask and see our app finally start taking shape. We will turn our drab database models into dynamically rendered HTML pages, using templates. We will come up with a URL scheme that reflects the ways we wish to organize our blog entries. As we progress through the chapter, our blog app will start looking like a proper website.  

In this chapter we shall:

## Introducing Jinja2 介绍Jinja2

Jinja2 is a fast, flexible, and secure templating engine. It allows you to define your website in small blocks that are pieced together to form complete pages. On our blog, for instance, we will have blocks for the header, the sidebar, the footer, as well as templates, for rendering blog posts. This approach is **DRY** (**Don't Repeat Yourself**), which means that the markup contained in each block should not be copied or pasted elsewhere. Since the HTML for each part of the site exists in only one place, making changes and fixing bugs is much easier. Jinja2 also allows you to embed display logic in the template. For instance, we may wish to display a log out button to users who are logged in, but display a log in form to users browsing anonymously. As you will see, it is very easy to accomplish these types of things with a bit of template logic.  

Jinja2是一个快速的、灵活的的安全模板引擎。它允许你定义

From the beginning, Flask was built with Jinja2 in mind, so working with templates in your Flask app is extremely easy. Since Jinja2 is a requirement of the Flask framework, it is already installed in our virtualenv, so we're able to get started immediately.  

Create a new folder named templates in the blog project's app directory. Create a single file inside the template folder named homepage.html and add the following HTML code:  

在blog项目的应用目录中创建一个新的名称为templates的文件夹。

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Blog</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now open views.py in the blog project's app directory. We are going to modify our homepage view to render the new homepage.html template. To do this, we will use Flask's render_template() function, passing in the name of our template as the first argument. Rendering a template is an extremely common action, so Flask makes this part as easy as possible:  

```python
from flask import render_template

from app import app

@app.route('/')
def homepage():
    return render_template('homepage.html')
```

Using the manage.py helper that we created in the previous chapter, start the development server and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view the rendered template, as shown in the following screenshot:  

```shell
(blog) $ python manage.py runserver
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
* Restarting with reloader
```

img:omit  


### Basic template operations 基本模板操作

The previous example may not seem very impressive, since we are doing little more than serving a plain HTML document. To make things interesting, we need to give our templates **context**. Let's modify our homepage to display a simple greeting to illustrate the point. Open `views.py` and make the following modifications:  

```python
from flask import render_template, request

from app import app


@app.route('/')
def homepage():
    name = request.args.get('name')
    if not name:
        name = '<unknown>'
    return render_template('homepage.html', name=name)
```

In the view code, we are passing name into the template context. The next step is to do something with that name inside the actual template. In this example, we will simply print the value of `name`. Open `homepage.html` and make the following addition:  

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Blog</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
    <p>Your name is {{ name }}.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Start the development server and navigate to the root URL. You should see something like the following image:  

img:omit  

Any keyword arguments passed to the render_template function are available in the template context. In the template language of Jinja2, double brackets are analogous to a print statement. We use the {{ name }} operation to output the value of name, which is set to `<unknown>`.  

>#### Tip
>The security-minded reader may have noticed that, when we viewed our template in the browser, the brackets were escaped. Ordinarily, brackets are treated by the browser as HTML markup, but, as you can see, Jinja2 has escaped the brackets automatically, replacing them with `&lt;` and `&gt;`.  

Try navigating to a URL such as http://127.0.0.1:5000/?name=Charlie. Whatever value you specify will appear, rendered for us automatically by Jinja2, as seen in the following image  

img:omit  

### Loops, control structures, and template programming 循环控制结构，以及模板编程

Jinja2 supports a miniature programming language that can be used to perform operations on data within the context. If all we could do was print values to the context, there honestly wouldn't be too much to be excited about. Things get interesting when we combine contextual data with things such as loops and control structures.  

Let's modify our homepage view once more. This time we will accept a number, in addition to a name, from request.args and display all the even numbers between 0 and that number. The neat part is that we will do almost all of this in the template. Make the following changes to views.py:  

```python
from flask import render_template, request

from app import app

@app.route('/')
def homepage():
    name = request.args.get('name')
    number = request.args.get('number')
    return render_template('homepage.html', name=name, number=number)
```

Now open the `hompage.html` template and add the following code. If it seems odd, don't worry. We will go through it line by line.  

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Blog</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
    {% if number %}
      <p>Your number is {{ number|int }}</p>
      <ul>
        {% for i in range(number|int) %}
          {% if i is divisibleby 2 %}
            <li>{{ i }}</li>
          {% endif %}
        {% endfor %}
      </ul>
    {% else %}
      <p>No number specified.</p>
    {% endif %}

    <p>Your name is {{ name|default('<unknown>', True) }}.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Start a runserver and experiment by passing some values in using the query-string. Also, take note of what happens when you pass a non-numeric value or a negative value.  

img:omit  

Let's go through our new template code line by line, starting with the {% if number %} statement. Unlike the print tags that use double curly brackets, logical tags use {% and %}. We are simply checking whether or not a number was passed into the context. If the number is None or an empty string, this test will fail, just as it would in Python.  

The next line prints the integer representation of our number and uses a new syntax, |int. The pipe symbol (|) is used in Jinja2 to indicate a call to a filter. A filter performs some type of operation on the value to the left side of the pipe symbol, and returns a new value. In this case, we are using the built-in int filter that converts a string to an integer, defaulting to 0 when a number cannot be determined. There are many filters built into Jinja2; we will discuss them later in the chapter.  

The {% for %} statement is used to create a for loop and looks remarkably close to Python. We are using the Jinja2 range helper to generate a series of numbers with [0, number). Note that we are again piping the number context value through the int filter in the call to range. Also note that we are assigning a value to a new context variable i. Inside the loop body, we can use i just like any other context variable.  

>#### Tip
>Of course, just like in regular Python, we can also use an {% else %} statement on a for-loop that can be used to run some code in the eventuality that there is nothing for the loop to do.

Now that we are looping through the numbers, we need to check whether i is even, and if so, print it. Jinja2 provides several ways we could do this, but I have chosen to show the use of a Jinja2 feature called tests. Like filters and control structures, Jinja2 also comes with a number of useful tools for testing the attributes of a context value. Tests are used in conjunction with {% if %} statements and are denoted by the use of the keyword is. So we have {% if i is divisibleby 2 %}, which is very easy to read. If the if statement evaluates to True then we will print the value of i using double braces: {{ i }}.  

>#### Tip
>Jinja2 provides a number of useful tests; to learn more check the project documentation at http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#tests.

Since Jinja2 is not aware of significant whitespace, we need to explicitly close all our logical tags. That is why you see an {% endif %} tag, signifying the closing of the divisibleby 2 check, and an {% endfor %}, signifying the closing of the for i in range loop. After the for loop, we are now in the outermost if statement, which tests whether a number was passed into the context. In the event no number is present, we want to print a message to the user so, before calling {% endif %}, we will use an {% else %} tag to display this message.  

Finally, we have changed the line that prints a greeting to the user to read `{{ name|default('<unknown>', True) }}` . In the view code, we removed the logic that set it to a default value of `<unknown>`. Instead, we have moved that logic into the template. Here we see the default filter (denoted by the | character) but, unlike int, we are passing multiple arguments. In Jinja2, a filter can take multiple arguments. By convention, the first argument appears to the left of the pipe symbol, since filters frequently operate on single values. In the event there are multiple arguments, these are specified in parentheses after the filter name. In the case of the default filter, we have specified the value to use in the event no name is specified.  

### Jinja2 built-in filters Jinja2内建过滤器

In the previous example, we saw how to use the int filter to coerce a context value to an integer. Along with int, Jinja2 provides a large array of useful built-in filters. For reasons of space (the list is very long), I will only include the most frequently-used filters from my experience, but the entire list can be found online at http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#list-of-builtin-filters.  

>#### Tip
>In the following examples, the first argument in the argument list would appear to the left-hand side of the pipe symbol. So, even though I have written abs(number), the filter used would be number|abs. When the filter accepts more than one parameter, the remaining parameters appear in parentheses after the filter name.  

|Filter and parameter(s)|Description and return value|
|:---------------------:|:--------------------------:|
|abs(number)|Returns the absolute value of the number.|
|default(value,default_value='',boolean=False)|In the event value is undefined (i.e., the name does not exist in the context) use the provided default_value instead. In the event you simply want to test whether value evaluates to a boolean True (i.e., not an empty string, the number zero, None, and so on.), then pass True as the third argument: {{ not_in_context|default:"The value was not in the context" }} ｛{ ''|default('An empty string.', True) }}|
|dictsort(value, case_sensitive=False, by='key')|Sorts a dictionary by key, yielding (key, value) pairs. You can also, however, sort by value.<p>Alphabetically by name.</p>{% for name, age in people|dictsort %} {{ name }} is {{ age }} years old. {% endfor %} <p>Youngest to oldest.</p> {% for name, age in people|dictsort(by='value') %} {{ name }} is {{ age }} years old. {% endfor %}|
|int(value, default=0)|Converts value to an integer. In the event the value cannot be converted, use the specified default.|
|length(object)|Returns the number of items in the collection.|
|reverse(sequence)|Reverses the sequence.|
|safe(value)|Outputs the value unescaped. This filter is useful when you have trusted HTML that you wish to print. For instance, if value = "<b>":
{{ value }} --> outputs &lt;b&gt;
{{ value|safe }} --> outputs <b>|
|sort(value, reverse=False, case_sensitive=False, attribute=None)|Sorts an iterable value. If reverse is specified, the items will be sorted in reverse order. If the attribute parameter is used, that attribute will be treated as the value to sort by.|
|striptags(value)|Removes any HTML tags, useful for cleaning up and outputting untrusted user input.|
|truncate(value, length=255, killwords=False, end='...')|Returns a truncated copy of the string. The length parameter specifies how many characters to keep. If killwords is False, then a word may be chopped in half; if True then Jinja2 will truncate at the previous word boundary. In the event the value exceeds the length and needs to be truncated, the value in end will be appended automatically.|
|urlize(value, trim_url_limit=None, nofollow=False, target=None)|Converts URLs in plain text into clickable links.|

>#### Tip
>Filters can be chained together, so {{ number|int|abs }} would first convert the number variable to an integer, then return its absolute value.  

## Creating a base template for the blog 为博客创建基本模板

Jinja2's inheritance and include features make it is very easy to define a base template that serves as the architectural foundation for each page on your site. The base template contains basic structural things that should never change, such as the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags, as well as the basic structure of the body. It can also be used to include style sheets or scripts that will be served on every page. Most importantly, the base template is responsible for defining overrideable blocks, into which we will place page-specific content such as the page title and body content.  

In order to get up-and-running quickly, we will be using Twitter's Bootstrap library (version 3). This will allow us to focus on how templates are structured and have a decent-looking site with minimal extra work. You are, of course, welcome to use your own CSS if you prefer, but the example code will use bootstrap-specific constructs.  

Create a new file in the templates directory named base.html, and add the following content:  

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>{% block title %}{% endblock %} | My Blog</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.1.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <style type="text/css">
      body { padding-top: 60px; }
    </style>
    {% block extra_styles %}{% endblock %}

    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>
    <script src="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.1.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
    {% block extra_scripts %}{% endblock %}
  </head>

  <body class="{% block body_class %}{% endblock %}">
    <div class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top" role="navigation">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="navbar-header">
          <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse">
            <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
            <span class="icon-bar"></span>
            <span class="icon-bar"></span>
            <span class="icon-bar"></span>
          </button>
          <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">{% block branding %}My Blog{% endblock %}</a>
        </div>
        <div class="collapse navbar-collapse">
          <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
            <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            {% block extra_nav %}{% endblock %}
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <h1>{% block content_title %}{% endblock %}</h1>
          {% block content %}
          {% endblock %}
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-3">
          {% block sidebar %}
          <ul class="well nav nav-stacked">
            <li><a href="#">Sidebar item</a></li>
          </ul>
          {% endblock %}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <hr />
        <footer>
          <p>&copy; your name</p>
        </footer>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Interspersed alongside the markup is a new Jinja2 tag, block. The block tags are used to indicate overrideable areas of the page.  

You may have noticed that we are serving jQuery and Bootstrap from publicly-available URLs. In the next chapter, we will discuss how to serve static files that are stored locally on disk. Now we can modify our homepage template and take advantage of the new base template. We can do this by extending the base template and overriding certain blocks. This works very similar to class inheritance that you find in most languages. As long as the sections of the inherited page are split up into blocks nicely, we can override only the bits we need to change. Let's open homepage.html and replace some of the current contents with the following:  

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content_title %}Welcome to my blog{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  {% if number %}
    <p>Your number is {{ number|int }}</p>
    <ul>
      {% for i in range(number|int) %}
        {% if i is divisibleby 2 %}
          <li>{{ i }}</li>
        {% endif %}
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  {% else %}
    <p>No number specified.</p>
  {% endif %}

  <p>Your name is {{ name|default('<unknown>', True) }}.</p>
{% endblock %}
```

By extending the original page, we have removed all the HTML boilerplate and a lot of complexity, focusing only on what makes this page, our homepage view, unique. Start up the server and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/, you will see that our homepage has been transformed.  

img:omit  

Congratulations! You have now learned some of the most commonly-used features of Jinja2. There are many more advanced features that we have not covered in the interests of time, and I would recommend reading the project's documentation to see the full range of possibilities with Jinja2. The documentation can be found at http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/.  

We still need to build templates to display our blog entries. Before continuing to build out templates, though, we first must create some view functions that will generate the lists of blog entries. We will then pass the entries into the context, just as we did with the homepage.  

## Creating a URL scheme 创建URL体系

URLs are for people, therefore they should be easy to remember. A good URL scheme is easy to remember when it accurately reflects the implicit structure of the website. Our goal is to create a URL scheme that makes it easy for the visitors on our site to find blog entries on topics that interest them.  

Referring back to the spec we created in Chapter 1, Creating Your First Flask Application, we know that we want our blog entries to be organized by tag and by date. Entries organized by tag and date will necessarily be a subset of the collection of all entries, so that gives us a structure like this:  

|URL|Purpose|
|:-:|:-----:|
|/entries/|This displays all of our blog entries, ordered most-recent first|
|/entries/tags/|This contains all the tags used to organize our blog entries|
|/entries/tags/python/|This contains all the entries tagged with python|
|/entries/learning-the-flask-framework/|This is a detail page showing the body content for a blog entry titled Learning the Flask Framework|

Since a single blog entry may be associated with multiple tags, how do we decide what to use as its canonical URL? If I wrote a blog entry titled Learning the Flask framework, I could conceivably nest it under /entries/, /entries/tags/python/, /entries/tags/flask/, and so on. That would violate one of the rules about good URLs, which is that a unique resource should have one, and only one, URL. For that reason, I am going to advocate putting individual blog entries at the top of the hierarchy:  

```
/entries/learning-the-flask-framework/
```

News sites and blogs with a large amount of time-sensitive content will typically nest individual pieces of content using the publication date. This prevents collisions when two articles might share the same title, but have been written at different times. When a lot of content is produced each day, this scheme often makes more sense:  

```
/entries/2014/jan/18/learning-the-flask-framework/
```

Although we will not be covering this type of URL scheme in this chapter, the code can be found online at http://www.packtpub.com/support.  

### Defining the URL routes 定义URL路径

Let's convert the structure described previously into some URL routes that Flask will understand. Create a new directory named entries in the blog project's app directory. Inside the entries directory, create two files, `__init__.py` and `blueprint.py` as follows:  

```shell
(blog) $ mkdir entries
(blog) $ touch entries/{__init__,blueprint}.py
```

**Blueprints** provide a nice API for encapsulating a group of related routes and templates. In smaller applications, typically everything gets registered on the app object (that is, app.route). When an application has distinct components, as ours does, blueprints can be used to separate the various moving parts. Since the /entries/ URL is going to be devoted entirely to our blog entries, we will create a blueprint and then define views to handle the routes that we described previously. Open blueprint.py and add the following code:  

```python
from flask import Blueprint

from models import Entry, Tag

entries = Blueprint('entries', __name__, template_folder='templates')

@entries.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Entries index'

@entries.route('/tags/')
def tag_index():
    pass

@entries.route('/tags/<slug>/')
def tag_detail(slug):
    pass

@entries.route('/<slug>/')
def detail(slug):
    pass
```

These URL routes are placeholders that we will fill in shortly, but I wanted to show you how clean and simple it is to translate a set of URL patterns into a set of routes and views.  

In order to access these new views, we need to register our blueprint with our main Flask app object. We will also instruct our app that we want our entries' URLs to live at the prefix /entries. Open main.py and make the following additions:  

```python
from app import app, db
import models
import views

from entries.blueprint import entries
app.register_blueprint(entries, url_prefix='/entries')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

If you want to test it out, start the debug server (python manage.py runserver) and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/entries/. You should see the following message:  

img:omit  

### Building the index view 构建索引视图

The index view is the top-most URL in our /entries/ hierarchy, and as such will contain all the entries. After a time we might have tens or even hundreds of blog entries, so we will want to paginate this list so as not to overwhelm our visitors (or our server!). Because we will frequently be displaying lists of objects, let's create a helpers module that will make it easy to display paginated lists of objects. In the app directory, create a new module named helpers.py and add the following code:  

```python
from flask import render_template, request

def object_list(template_name, query, paginate_by=20, **context):
    page = request.args.get('page')
    if page and page.isdigit():
        page = int(page)
    else:
        page = 1
    object_list = query.paginate(page, paginate_by)
    return render_template(template_name, object_list=object_list, **context)
```

Now, we will open entries/blueprint.py and modify the index view to return a paginated list of entries:  


```python
from flask import Blueprint

from helpers import object_list
from models import Entry, Tag

entries = Blueprint('entries', __name__, template_folder='templates')

@entries.route('/')
def index():
    entries = Entry.query.order_by(Entry.created_timestamp.desc())
    return object_list('entries/index.html', entries)
```

We are importing the object_list helper function and passing it the name of a template and the query representing the entries we wish to display. As we build out the rest of these views, you will see how little helper functions such as object_list make Flask development quite easy.  

The final piece is the entries/index.html template. In the entries directory, create a directory named templates, and a sub-directory named entries. Create index.html such that the full path from the app directory is entries/templates/entries/index.html and add the following code:  

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block title %}Entries{% endblock %}

{% block content_title %}Entries{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  {% include "includes/list.html" %}
{% endblock %}
```

This template is very minimal, all the work will happen in includes/list.html. The {% include %} tag is new, and is useful for reusable template fragments. Create the file includes/list.html and add the following code:  

```html
{% for entry in object_list.items %}
  <p><a href="{{ url_for('entries.detail', slug=entry.slug) }}">{{ entry.title }}</a></p>
{% endfor %}
```

The `url_for` function is extremely useful. `url_for()` allows us to provide the name of a view function or any arguments, and then generates the URL. Since the URL we wish to reference is the detail view of the entries blueprint, the name of the view is entries.detail. The detail view accepts a single argument, the slug of the entry's title.  

Before building out the detail view, re-open the base template and add a link to the entries in the navigation section:  

```html
<ul class="nav navbar-nav">
  <li><a href="{{ url_for('homepage') }}">Home</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ url_for('entries.index') }}">Blog</a></li>
  {% block extra_nav %}{% endblock %}
</ul>
```

The following screenshot shows the updated navigation header, along with a list of blog entries:  

img:omit  

### Building the detail view 构建详细视图

Let's create a simple view that will render the contents of a single blog entry. The slug of the entry will be passed in as a part of the URL. We will attempt to match that to an existing Entry, returning a 404 response if none matches. Update the following code to the detail view in the entries blueprint:  

```python
from flask import render_template
@entries.route('/<slug>/')
def detail(slug):
    entry = Entry.query.filter(Entry.slug == slug).first_or_404()
    return render_template('entries/detail.html', entry=entry)
```

Create a template in the entries template directory named detail.html and add the following code. We will display the title and body of the entry in the main content area, but in the sidebar we will display a list of tags and the date the entry was created:  

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block title %}{{ entry.title }}{% endblock %}

{% block content_title %}{{ entry.title }}{% endblock %}

{% block sidebar %}
  <ul class="well nav nav-list">
    <li><h4>Tags</h4></li>
    {% for tag in entry.tags %}
      <li><a href="{{ url_for('entries.tag_detail', slug=tag.slug) }}">{{ tag.name }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

  <p>Published {{ entry.created_timestamp.strftime('%m/%d/%Y') }}</p>
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  {{ entry.body }}
{% endblock %}
```


It should now be possible to view entries on the index page and follow the link to the details view. As you probably guessed, the next thing we need to tackle is the tag detail page.  

img:omit  

### Listing entries matching a given tag 列出匹配给定标签的博文

Listing the entries that match a given tag will combine the logic from the two previous views. First we will need to look up the Tag using the tag slug provided in the URL, and then we will display an object_list of Entry objects that are tagged with the specified tag. In the tag_detail view, add the following code:  

```python
@entries.route('/tags/<slug>/')
def tag_detail(slug):
    tag = Tag.query.filter(Tag.slug == slug).first_or_404()
    entries = tag.entries.order_by(Entry.created_timestamp.desc())
    return object_list('entries/tag_detail.html', entries, tag=tag)
```

The `entries` query

will get all the entries associated with the tag, then return them ordered most-recent first. We are also passing the tag into the context so we can display it in the template. Create the tag_detail.html template and add the following code. Since we are going to display a list of entries, we will re-use our list.html include:  

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block title %}{{ tag.name }} entries{% endblock %}

{% block content_title %}{{ tag.name }} entries{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  {% include "includes/list.html" %}
{% endblock %}
```

In the following screenshot, I have navigated to /entries/tags/python/. This page only contains entries that have been tagged with Python:

### Listing all the tags 列出所有的标签

The final missing piece is the view that will display a list of all the tags. This view will be very similar to the index entry, except that, instead of Entry objects, we will be querying the Tag model. Update the following code to the tag_index view:  

```python
@entries.route('/tags/')
def tag_index():
    tags = Tag.query.order_by(Tag.name)
    return object_list('entries/tag_index.html', tags)
```

In the template, we will display each tag as a link to the corresponding tag detail page. Create the file entries/tag_index.html and add the following code:  

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block title %}Tags{% endblock %}

{% block content_title %}Tags{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  <ul>
    {% for tag in object_list.items %}
      <li><a href="{{ url_for('entries.tag_detail', slug=tag.slug) }}">{{ tag.name }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% endblock %}
```

If you like, you can add a link to the tag list in the base template's navigation.  

### Full-text search 全文搜索

In order to allow users to find posts containing certain words or phrases, we will add simple full-text search to the pages that contain lists of blog entries. To accomplish this, we will do some refactoring. We will be adding a search form to the sidebar of all pages containing lists of blog entries. While we could copy and paste the same code into both `entries/index.html` and `entries/tag_detail.html`, we will, instead, create another base template that contains the search widget. Create a new template named `entries/base_entries.html` and add the following code:  

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block sidebar %}
  <form class="form-inline well" method="get" role="form">
    <div class="input-group">
      <input class="form-control input-xs" name="q" placeholder="Search..." value="{{ request.args.get('q', '') }}" />
      <span class="input-group-btn">
        <button class="btn btn-default" type="submit">Go</button>
      </span>
    </div>
  </form>
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  {% include "includes/list.html" %}
{% endblock %}
```

>#### Tip
>Even though we will not explicitly pass request into the context, Flask will make it accessible. You can find the list of standard context variables in the Flask documentation at http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/templating/#standard-context.

Now we will update the entries/index.html and entries/tag_detail.html to utilize this new base template. Since
the content block contains the list of entries, we can remove that from both templates:  

```html
{% extends "entries/base_entries.html" %}

{% block title %}Entries{% endblock %}

{% block content_title %}Entries{% endblock %}
```

This is how `entries/index.html` looks after changing the base template and removing the context block. Do the same to entries/tag_detail.html.  

```html
{% extends "entries/base_entries.html" %}
{% block title %}Tags{% endblock %}
{% block content_title %}Tags{% endblock %}
```

Now we need to update our view code to actually perform the search. To do this, we will create a new helper function in the blueprint named entry_list. This helper will be much like the object_list helper, but will perform extra logic to filter results based on our search inquiry. Add the entry_list function to the blueprint.py. Note how it checks the request query-string for a parameter named q. If q is present, we will return only the entries that contain the search phrase in either the title or the body:  

```python
from flask import request
def entry_list(template, query, **context):
    search = request.args.get('q')
    if search:
        query = query.filter(
            (Entry.body.contains(search)) |
            (Entry.title.contains(search)))
    return object_list(template, query, **context)
```

In order to utilize this functionality, modify the `index` and `tag_detail` views to call `entry_list` instead of `object_list`. The updated `index` view looks as follows:  

```python
@entries.route('/')
def index():
    entries = Entry.query.order_by(Entry.created_timestamp.desc())
    return entry_list('entries/index.html', entries)
```

Congratulations! You can now navigate to the entries list and perform searches using the search form.

## Adding pagination links 添加分页链接

As we discussed earlier, we would like to paginate long lists of entries so that users are not overwhelmed with extremely long lists. We have actually done all the work in the object_list function; the only remaining task is to add links allowing users to travel from one page of entries to the next.  

Because pagination links are a feature we will use in several places, we will create the pagination include in our app's template directory (as opposed to the entries template directory). Create a new directory in app/templates/ named includes and create a file named page_links.html. Since object_list returns us a PaginatedQuery object, we can utilize this object to determine, in the template, what page we are on and how many pages there are in total. In order to make the pagination links look nice, we will be using CSS classes provided by Bootstrap. Add the following content to page_links.html:  

```html
<ul class="pagination">
  <li{% if not object_list.has_prev %} class="disabled"{% endif %}>
    {% if not object_list.has_prev %}
      <a href="./?page={{ object_list.prev_num }}">&laquo;</a>
    {% else %}
      <a href="#">&laquo;</a>
    {% endif %}
  </li>
  {% for page in object_list.iter_pages() %}
    <li>
      {% if page %}
        <a {% if page == object_list.page %}class="active" {% endif %}href="./?page={{ page }}">{{ page }}</a>
      {% else %}
        <a class="disabled">...</a>
      {% endif %}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
  <li{% if not object_list.has_next %} class="disabled"{% endif %}>
    {% if object_list.has_next %}
      <a href="./?page={{ object_list.next_num }}">&raquo;</a>
    {% else %}
      <a href="#">&raquo;</a>
    {% endif %}
  </li>
</ul>
```

Now, wherever we are displaying an object list, let's include the page_links.html template at the bottom of the page. Currently, the only templates we will need to update are entries/base_entries.html and entries/tag_index.html. The content block of base_entries.html looks as follows:  

```html
{% block content %}
  {% include "includes/list.html" %}
  {% include "includes/page_links.html" %}
{% endblock %}
```

## Enhancing the blog app 增强博客应用

Before continuing on to the next chapter, I recommend spending some time experimenting with the views and templates we created in this chapter. Here are a few ideas you might consider:  

- Sort the list of tags on the entry detail view (hint: use the sort filter on the tag's name attribute).
- Remove the example code from the homepage template and add your own content.
- You may have noticed that we are displaying all entries regardless of their status. Modify the entry_list function and the entry detail view to only display Entry objects whose status is STATUS_PUBLIC.
- Experiment with different Bootstrap themes- http://bootswatch.com has many available for free.
- Advanced: allow multiple tags to be specified. For example, /entries/tags/flask+python/ would only display entries that are tagged with both flask and python.

## Summary 总结

We covered a lot of information in this chapter, and by now you should be familiar with the process of creating views and templates. We learned how to render Jinja2 templates and how to pass data from the view into the template context. We also learned how to modify context data within the template, using Jinja2 tags and filters. In the second half of the chapter, we designed a URL structure for our site and translated it into Flask views. We added a simple full-text search feature to the site, and wrapped up by adding pagination links to our lists of entries and tags.  

在这一章，我们包含了很多的信息，现在你应该熟悉了创建视图和模板的过程。我们学习了如何渲染Jinja2模板，以及如何从视图传递数据到模板上下文种。我们也学习了如何修改模板中的上下文数据，使用Jinja2标签和过滤器。本章后半段，我们为站点设计了URL结构，并翻译为Flask视图。我们对站点添加了一个简单的全文视图，然后通过对博文和标签列表添加分页链接将网站包装起来。  

In the next chapter, we will learn how to create and edit blog entries through the website using Forms. We will learn how to process and validate user input, then save the changes to the database. We will also add a photo-uploading feature so we can embed images in our blog entries.  

在接下来的章节，我们学习了如何使用表单在整个站点中创建和编辑博客博文。我们将学习如何处理和验证用户输入，然后保存变更到数据库。我们也会添加照片上传功能，这样我们就能够在博客的博文中嵌入图片。
